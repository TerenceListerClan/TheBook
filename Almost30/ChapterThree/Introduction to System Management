This is the chapter where I would talk about my introduction to true System management. It would be broken up something
like this:
* That time I started working on SD
* That time I integrated a 3rd party with SD
* That time I started working the SD replacement
* That time I was surprised in rankings
* That time I worked with IBM on an SNMP definition for System Management
* That time I decided to move up
