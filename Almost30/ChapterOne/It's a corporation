This is where I start talking about the fact that a corporation makes decisions based on their best understanding and they do not communicate at all well with the ones doing the work, where a little coordination would go a long way towards building high performance teams.
A couple of things to mention:
  * The first time I worked all weekend to release a product only to come in Monday morning to a delayed release
  * That first trip I took where no one went with me because the flight was canceled - I mean, really?
  * That time I worked with an arrogant engineer on a product that was insanely hard to develop, compile and deliver
  * That time I worked with a hilarious engineer who taught me that humor was often a good thing
  
  * That time I was walked out of my office and given my "first big opportunity"...
  * That time I was ready to sweep the floors, I was even given a broom - interesting ways to motivate others
  * That time I finished my first firmware project despite the difficulties mentioned previously
  * That time I saw my first "right-sizing" - It's a layoff people, let's not make it more than it is please!
