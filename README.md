# TheBook
The name of the repository comes from the fact that I've actually nearly had a career given that I've been at the same company for 29.83 years. I was informed on 6/12/2017 that I was impacted by work force reduction. A very interesting term - in my opinion.

What I may use this for is ideas I have around my nearly 30 years at the same company and how that could almost be considered a career. As I re-learn development technologies, I'll capture some of those learnings here as well.

Feel completely free to ignore all this for now, as I'm just getting started!
