# TheBook
The name of the repository is around having my collaborators - namely family members. I formed this repo around the idea that I want to write a book about my experiences in the company where I worked. If it turns out someone would like to publish it, I'll do the work to lock that down then. Right now, I'm using this to deal with the fact that I was informed on 6/12/2017 that I was impacted by work force reduction. A very interesting term - in my opinion.

What I intend to use this for is ideas I have around my nearly 30 years at the same company and how that could almost be considered a career. As I re-learn development technologies, I'll capture some of those learnings in https://github.com/terencelister/explorations repository.

Feel completely free to ignore all this for now, as I'm just getting started!
